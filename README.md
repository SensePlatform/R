# Sense R

A slight modification of [R](http://cran.r-project.org) version 2.15.2
for use with 
[the R engine for Sense](https://github.com/SensePlatform/sense-r-engine). 
This version of R is preinstalled on Sense, but you might want to 
install it locally if you want to develop or modify the engine.

## Installation and usage

Installation is exactly the same as for the main version of R. See
INSTALL and [the R website](http://cran.r-project.org) for details.

Usage is also the same, except running `R --sense` will start the
modified version of R. This version emits the special output tokens
that the engine uses to discriminate text output, errors, prompts,
html output, etc.
